Electron boilerplate with p5.js... including p5.dom and p5.sound

This is a fork of [remyroez/electron-p5-boilerplate](https://github.com/remyroez/electron-p5-boilerplate), which uses p5.js version 0.5.5, that now **gives access to the p5.dom.js and p5.sound.js libraries** when running in instance mode.

I would like to port this to the most current p5 version.
